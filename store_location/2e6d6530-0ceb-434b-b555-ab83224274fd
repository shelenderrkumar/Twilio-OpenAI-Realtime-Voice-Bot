Shippers must ensure the presence of a banking invoice during parcel pickup, a responsibility that falls on the shipper rather than the InstaWorld representative. Payment modes are restricted to cash only, with no acceptance of cheques, P.O., or demand drafts. Clients are required to make cash payments during delivery. Failure to produce the necessary cash payment at the time of delivery will result in the non- delivery of the shipment. In the event of the recipient's unavailability, InstaWorld will make delivery attempts. If additional reattempts are needed after two attempts, a 100% charge will be applied to the agreed delivery amount, and the shipper is responsible for covering any associated courier charges.\n\nPayment transactions will occur through bank transfer/IBFT based on instructions received during account opening. Volumetric or dimensional weight will be calculated, and the greater value between the volumetric and actual weight, rounded up to the nearest kilogram, will be used to determine service charges. The formula for volumetric weight calculation is as follows: Width X Length X Height in cm/5000 = Volumetric Weight in kilograms.\n\nInstaWorld OPERATION'S PROCESS:\n\nPickups will be processed same day if orders are placed before 4pm. anything after will be on a best effort's basis. Pickup location will be defined by shipper POC at time of booking. There are 2 attempts for each delivery. Delivery status and failed reasons will be shared.\n\nInstaWorld CLAIMS:\n\nClaims will not be acceptable in case the damage has resulted from improper packaging of the shipment by the shipper. (You can get the packing protocols details from your sales person)\n\nClaims will be processed in 45 working days from the date of lodgment of the claim.", "type": "Document"}}
